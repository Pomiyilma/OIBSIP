          ABOUT JORDAN B. PETERSON
        </h2>
        <div class="description-content">
          <p>
            Dr. Jordan B. Peterson is a Canadian clinical psychologist, cultural critic, and professor of psychology.
            He gained widespread recognition for his critiques of political correctness and his perspectives on cultural
            and political issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born on June 12, 1962, Peterson is known for his lectures on topics such as personal responsibility,
            psychology, philosophy, and religion. His bestselling book "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos"
            has sold millions of copies worldwide and has been translated into over 50 languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peterson's work emphasizes the importance of individual responsibility, the pursuit of meaning,
            and the integration of shadow aspects of personality. He has become one of the most influential
            public intellectuals of our time, with millions of followers across various social media platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            His teachings often focus on classical ideas from psychology, mythology, religion, literature,
            philosophy, and neuroscience to illustrate how individuals can improve their lives and contribute
            positively to society.
